# cpoly
Polynom library in C based on GSL

# usage
Polynomes are:
![equ1](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cmathrm%7BP%7D%28x%29%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7Bk%3D0%7D%5En%20a_k%20x%5Ek "equ1")
, which is represented this way:
```
{1, -2, 3}
```
this is equvalent to ![equ2](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1%20x%5E2%20-%202x%20&plus;%203 "equ2")
which is a polynim os degree **2**.
